# PulseModem SSTV

PulseModem SSTV is an macOS app that generates SSTV files in different formats.

It currently works on Apple Silicon Macs running macOS Ventura.

## How does it work?

It runs a Python runtime to interface with [pySSTV](https://github.com/dnet/pySSTV) for the audio generation.

Audio generated are saved along with the picture using CoreData.
